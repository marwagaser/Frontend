# rewaTer

rewaTer (rewards + water) is a point reward based application in residential areas; such that, a quota is calculated using
statistical research about different areas’ water requirement and then comparing it to the
average water consumption to get the quota. Therefore, when a certain house’s water meter
reading is below the quota with respect to the number of people in the house, the user is
granted points which will reward him with offers later on. The points can then be used to redeem vouchers or promo codes provided by the sponsors.
